# francoiskha forked dotfiles

## dotfiles

Your dotfiles are how you personalize your system. These are mine.

I forked Zach Holman's as [he meant them to be](http://zachholman.com/2010/08/dotfiles-are-meant-to-be-forked/). I made the thing work with oh-my-zsh [as Aniket Pant did](http://aniketpant.com/2013/04/get-your-dotfiles-straight/).

## install

Install [oh-my-zsh](http://ohmyz.sh/).

Run this:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/holman/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
script/bootstrap
```

## more

See [@holman's dotfile repo](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles) for more information about how it works.
